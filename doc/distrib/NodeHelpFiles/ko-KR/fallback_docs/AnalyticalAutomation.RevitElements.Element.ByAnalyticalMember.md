## 상세
This node creates a physical structural element from an analytical member or updates an existing physical element that is already connected to the analytical member. The node can update geometry or parameters of the physical element based on the analytical member, depending on the input settings. When the analytical member is not associated with any physical element, the physical element is created using the analytical member’s information.

In this example, an analytical member from the ACO Supermarket project is selected from a structural column. That analytical member is connected to this node, and a Boolean input is used to show the default settings for updating geometry and parameters. The node produces the corresponding physical column based on the analytical model.
