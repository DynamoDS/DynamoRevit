## 상세
This node creates a new Elevation Marker in the active Revit document by specifying the View Type and a location point in the model.

In this example, a point is created at the desired location where the elevation will be placed. This point is provided as the location input to the ElevationMarker.ByViewTypeLocation node, along with a specified view type family and scale factor. The resulting ElevationMarker is then used to generate the elevation views at the defined scale.
