## 상세
This node returns the Revit curve reference associated with a given grid element.

In this example all grid elements are selected in the project and used as an input to GridElementCUrveReference node.  This node exposes that reference so it can be used in other operations such as dimensioning, path-based element placement, or geometric analysis.
