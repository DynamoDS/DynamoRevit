## In profondità
This node creates a structural column based on a curve, a level, and a column family type. The output is the newly created structural column element in the project.

In this example, a line is drawn at grid crossing A4 between levels L1 35 Low and L3 in the Snowdon structural model.. The node uses this curve, along with the selected level and column type, to create a structural column.
