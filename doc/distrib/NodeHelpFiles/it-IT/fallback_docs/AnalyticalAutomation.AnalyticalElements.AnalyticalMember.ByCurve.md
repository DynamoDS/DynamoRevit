## In profondità
This node creates an analytical member from a curve.

In this example, two points are defined by extracting the locations of the grid intersections at A4 and A5 in the Snowdon Structural model. A level, L2 TOS, is used to set the vertical position of both points. A line is created by connecting these points and provided as input to this node. The output is the analytical member representing the defined curve.
