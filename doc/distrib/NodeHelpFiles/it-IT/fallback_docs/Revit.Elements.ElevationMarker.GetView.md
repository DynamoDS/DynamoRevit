## In profondità
This node retrieves a specific Elevation View from an Elevation Marker based on a given index value.  An elevation marker can host up to four elevations (one for each direction). This node allows you to extract one of those associated elevation views for further use or modification (0,1,2,3).

In this example, all elevation markers are selected and used for input elevationMarker along with all the index options 0,1,2,3.  The output shows all possible elevation direction and a null if no elevation exists.  The last node displays the total number of elevations associated with a given element marker.
