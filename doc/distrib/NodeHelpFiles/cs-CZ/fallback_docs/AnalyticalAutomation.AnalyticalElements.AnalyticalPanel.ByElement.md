## Podrobnosti
This node creates an analytical panel from a selected model element.

In this example, a floor element is selected from the Snowdon Structural model and provided as input to the node. The node can update the panel’s geometry and parameters based on the source element, optionally add or maintain an association with the element, and include any openings found in the original element. The output is the resulting analytical panel.
