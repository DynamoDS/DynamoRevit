## Podrobnosti
This node provides a list of available Rule Types that can be used when creating or defining filter rules.  For example, whether it equals, contains, is greater than, or begins with a specific value.

In this example, a wall type is identified and the “Fire Rating” parameter is selected to create a filter rule with the value “2HR” and the Select Rule Type set to “Equals.” This FilterRule is then applied to the “L1 Wall Base” view as a view filter.
