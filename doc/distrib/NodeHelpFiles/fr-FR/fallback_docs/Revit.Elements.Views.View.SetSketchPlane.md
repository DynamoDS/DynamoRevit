## Description approfondie
This node sets the default sketch plane in a given view.

In this example all sketch planes are retrieved from the project and filtered down to the “Parking” sketch plane.  This “Parking” sketch plane is then used as an input (SketchPlane) to node View.SetSketchPlane along with a view (view).  The last two nodes show the original sketch plane name along side the new sketch plane name.
