## 詳細
This node creates a new Reference Plane in the model by defining its start and end points.

In this example two points are generated with Point.ByCoordinates using numeric inputs. These points are then fed into ReferencePlane.ByStartPointEndPoint, which creates a custom reference plane directly between the two coordinates.
