## Em profundidade
This node checks whether a surface is valid for creating an opening in an analytical panel.

In this example, four points at grid intersections A4–A5 and B4–B5 in the Snowdon Structural model define the intended opening location. The level L2 sets the vertical placement. Lines connect the points and are offset to form the surface representing the opening. A floor at L2 is used to create the analytical panel, and this node evaluates the surface for its validity as an opening in that panel.
