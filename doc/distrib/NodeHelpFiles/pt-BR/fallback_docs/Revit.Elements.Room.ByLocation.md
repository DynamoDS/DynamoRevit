## Em profundidade
This node creates a room based on points, a level, a room name and a room number.

In this example, points are derived from the families inside an enclosure (not defined as a room).  These points are used as the “location” input along with a given level, a room name and room number.  The node after the Room.ByLocation extracts the room name and room number parameters that were created to show the node successfully ran.
