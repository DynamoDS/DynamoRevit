## Em profundidade
`ScheduleView.AddFields` adds the selected fields to the schedule. Schedulable fields represent available parameters of the category assigned to the schedule.

In the example below, a new schedule called "Working Door Schedule" is created. The schedulable fields are then collected and input into a dictionary to facilitate looking the fields up by name. Finally, the fields are found by name and added to the schedule view with `ScheduleView.AddFields`.
