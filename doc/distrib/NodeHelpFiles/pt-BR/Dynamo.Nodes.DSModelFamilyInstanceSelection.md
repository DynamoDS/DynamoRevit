## Em profundidade
`Select Family Instance` allows for a selection of a single family instance in the current Revit document. `Select Family Instance` differs from `Select Model Element` by providing an isolated selection of family instances. With `Select Family Instance`, only loadable families can be selected. _Eg. Windows, Doors, Generic Models._

In the example below, a single window family is selected from the current Revit document.
