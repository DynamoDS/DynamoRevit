## Im Detail
This node moves an element to a new location given a new point.

In this example, an element is selected and input in the Element.SetLocation node.  The elements’ original position is shown and used to translate along the x and y plane, which is controlled by the number slider.  The translation output is used as the geometry input for Element.SetLocation.  A null value will be displayed but the element is moving.
