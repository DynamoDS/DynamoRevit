## Im Detail
This node creates a structural brace based on a curve, a level, and a framing family type. The output is the newly created brace element in the project.

In this example, a line is drawn from level L2 at grid crossing A4 to level L3 at grid crossing A5. The node uses this curve, along with the selected level and family type, to create a brace in the Snowdon structural model.
