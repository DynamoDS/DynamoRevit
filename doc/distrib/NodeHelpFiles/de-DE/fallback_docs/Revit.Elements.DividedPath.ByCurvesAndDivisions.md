## Im Detail
This node creates a Divided Path element in a massing family by dividing curves into a specified number of equal segments.

In this example, 2 model curves are created from a specified start point and end point, then used as the input curve for the DividedPath.ByCurvesAndDivisions node. An integer value defines the number of equal divisions along the curves. The final node displays the resulting division points along the curves.
