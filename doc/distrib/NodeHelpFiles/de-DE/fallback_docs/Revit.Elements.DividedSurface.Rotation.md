## Im Detail
This node returns the rotation angle (in degrees) applied to a given Divided Surface in Revit. The rotation defines how the grid pattern on the surface is oriented relative to the surface’s natural U and V directions.

In this example, a face is selected and used to create a divided surface.  This divided surface output is used as the input for the DividedSurface.Rotation node.  The output is the rotation factor applied to divided surface (in degrees).  The last nodes expose the values of the divided surface.  When running this example graph, you will need to observe the Revit warning and delete the suggested elements so that the grids will appear on the surface selected.
