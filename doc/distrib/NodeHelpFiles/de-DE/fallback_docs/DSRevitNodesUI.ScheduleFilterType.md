## Im Detail
This node has a drop down list of allowable schedule filter types (Equal, NotEqual, GreaterThan,LessThan, Contains,..).   The results will filter all doors that begin with "Exterior"

In this example a view is selected and the view fields are exposed.  The "Type" field is isolated and used to create a schedule filter along with a filter value and a schedule filter type "BeginsWith."  This filter is then applied to the selected schedule view "WV_Wall Schedule."
