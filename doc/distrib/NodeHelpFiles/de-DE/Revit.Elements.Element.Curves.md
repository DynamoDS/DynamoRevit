## Im Detail
`Element.Curves` returns the curve geometry for the given element. If no curve geometry is present an empty list is returned.

In the example below, a warning for overlapping walls and room separators is selected. The elements involved in this warning are then extracted for further analysis. With `Element.Solids` and `Element.Curves` it is demonstrated that the overlap occurs within the wall.
