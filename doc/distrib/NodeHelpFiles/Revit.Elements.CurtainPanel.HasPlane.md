`CurtainPanel.HasPlane` checks to see if the input curtain panel is planar. If it is not planar, a false value is returned. If it is planar, a true value is returned.

In the example below, a curtain wall element is selected by element id, along with all of the curtain panels within the wall element. The curtain panels are then checked to see if they are planar with `CurtainPanel.HasPlane`.
