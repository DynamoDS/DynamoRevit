## 深入資訊
This node identifies the unit type used for length measurements in the active Revit project and outputs its unit type identifier as a string value.

In this example, the UnitsUtilities.GetCurrentProjectLengthUnit node is placed in the graph with a Watch node connected to its output. The Watch node displays the current project length unit as a string (for example, Feet).
