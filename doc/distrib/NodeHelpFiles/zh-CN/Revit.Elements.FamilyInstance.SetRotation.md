## 详细
`FamilyInstance.SetRotation` sets the rotation of a family instance on an individual basis. `FamilyInstance.SetRotation` will rotate each family instance about it's Z axis. This differs from rotating elements directly in Revit, where a rotation command rotates selected elements about a common center point.

In the example below, all entourage families in the current Revit document are rotated at a random value between 0 and 360.
