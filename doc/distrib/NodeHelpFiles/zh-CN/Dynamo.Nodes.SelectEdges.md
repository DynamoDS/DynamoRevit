## 详细

`Select Edges` displays a cursor in Revit that allows you to select multiple edges. The objects returned are curves or lines that represent the selected edges.

In the example below, two lines are returned that represent the top edges of a parapet in the current document (file). Additionally, `Select Edges` reports the owning element ids of the edges that are selected.
