## 详细
This node finds all connection nodes that are permutations of one another { [beam1, beam2], [beam2, beam1] }, keeps only the first node { [beam1, beam2] } and removes null and empty items.

In this example, three beams that meet at a single intersection are selected to show the default behavior of each connection node and how the number of possible permutations is reduced.
