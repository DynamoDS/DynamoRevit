## En detalle:
This dropdown node provides a list of Revit “View Parts Visibility” options that control whether Parts (elements created by the Parts command, such as subdivided walls, floors, etc.) are visible, hidden, or shown instead of their original elements in a given Revit view.

In this example, a view is selected (3D View) and used as a input (view) to node View.SetPartsVisibility along with any of the default value from node View Parts Visibilities. The last 2 nodes show the view parts visibility setting at it original setting and its revised setting.
