## Подробности
The Revision.ByName node in Dynamo is used to create or access a revision within a Revit project by specifying its name. This node provides control over several revision parameters, including revision date, description, issued status, issued by, issued to, visibility, and numbering type. By leveraging this node, users can automate the revision process in Revit.

The provided Dynamo graph demonstrates the automation of revision creation by connecting project-specific inputs to the Revision.ByName node. Key details such as revision set name, date, description, consultant, client, visibility option, and numbering type are supplied as inputs. Once executed, the node generates or updates the revision in Revit based on these parameters. This workflow minimizes manual data entry, enforces standardization, and streamlines revision management across project sheets.
