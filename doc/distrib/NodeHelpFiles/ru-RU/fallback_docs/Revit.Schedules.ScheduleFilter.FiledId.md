## Подробности
This node retrieves the ScheduleFieldId associated with a given ScheduleFilter.  Each schedule filter in Revit is linked to a specific field (for example, Level, Family and Type, Area). This node exposes that connection by returning the field identifier used by the filter.

In this example, a schedule filter is created and used as the input to ScheduleFilter.FileId.
