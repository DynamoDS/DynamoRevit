## Подробности
This node sets how Parts are displayed within a specified Revit View. This node allows you to control whether the view shows; "ShowPartsOnly", "ShowOriginalOnly", "ShowPartsAndOriginal", or "unset".

In this example, a view is selected (3D View) and used as a input (view) to node View.SetPartsVisibility along with any of the default value from node View Parts Visibilities. The last 2 nodes show the view parts visibility setting at it original setting and its revised setting.
