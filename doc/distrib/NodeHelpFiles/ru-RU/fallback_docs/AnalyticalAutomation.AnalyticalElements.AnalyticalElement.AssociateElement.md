## Подробности
This node associates an analytical element with a physical model element so they reference each other. If an association already exists, it can replace it when allowed by the node settings.

In this example, two points at grid intersections A4 and A5 in the Snowdon structural model define the location. A level (L2 TOS) establishes the vertical placement, and a line between these points forms the analytical member. A physical beam in the same location is then selected, and this node links the analytical element to that beam.
