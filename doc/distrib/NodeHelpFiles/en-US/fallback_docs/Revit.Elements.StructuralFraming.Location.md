## In Depth
This node extracts the curve geometry from the location of a structural framing element. The output provides information such as the start and end points of the curve, the direction vector, and the length.

In this example, a beam is selected in the Snowdon structural model. The node outputs the curve data that defines the beam’s location in the project.
