## In Depth
This node sets the curve of an existing detail curve.

In this example 2 lines are created, and one is used to create a detail curve along with a view (Partition Type – CMU).  This detailCurve is then used as an input to “detailCurve” for DetailCurve.SetCurve along with the second line as an input to “curve.”  The output reads null but the detail curve has been changed to the new position.
