## In Depth
This node retrieves the detailed description of a failure or warning generated by a Performance Adviser Rule. It translates the failure into clear, readable text so that users can better understand the issue.

In this example, the Performance Adviser Rule checks if “View clipping is disabled”. The results are processed through the FailureMessage.Description node, which outputs a descriptive message explaining the reason behind the failure.
