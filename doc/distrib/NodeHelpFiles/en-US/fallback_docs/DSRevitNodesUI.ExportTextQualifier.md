## In Depth
This node provides a drop-down list to choose how text fields should be wrapped or qualified when exporting data to a text-based format (often CSV-style exports)..  These values will define the character that will surround text values in an exported schedule.  (Example; DoubleQuote, The quote character - " - is used to qualify text.  None, No text qualifier.  Quote, The quote character - ' - is used to qualify text).

In this example Export Text Qualifier (Quote) is used as an input to the ScheduleView.Export node to generate a typical export option.
