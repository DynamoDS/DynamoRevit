## In Depth
This node is used to create or access a revision within a Revit project by specifying its name. This node provides control over several revision parameters, including revision date, description, issued status, issued by, issued to, visibility, and numbering type.

This example demonstrates the automation of revision creation by connecting project-specific inputs to the Revision.ByName node. Key details such as revision set name, date, description, consultant, client, visibility option, and numbering type are supplied as inputs. Once executed, the node generates or updates the revision in Revit based on these parameters.
