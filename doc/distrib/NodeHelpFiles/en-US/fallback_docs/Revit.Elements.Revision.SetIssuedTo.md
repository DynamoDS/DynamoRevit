## In Depth
The Revision.SetIssuedTo node is used to set or update the “Issued To” value of a revision in Revit. It helps automate the process of recording the recipient of a revision, ensuring accuracy and consistency in project documentation without manual entry in Revit.

In this graph, the Select Revision node is used to choose the required revision, while a string input (e.g., XYZ) defines the recipient. The Revision.SetIssuedTo node then applies this value to the selected revision, updating the “Issued To” field directly in the Revit model.
