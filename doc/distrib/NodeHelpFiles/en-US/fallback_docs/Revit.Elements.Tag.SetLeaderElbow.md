## In Depth
This node sets the location of the elbow point in a “free-end” tag.

In this example, a tag is selected, and the original points are extracted.  The X value is modified and the new XYZ points are defined and used as an input for location to node Tag.SetLeaderElbow along with the original tag selected.  The output is the new location of the tags' elbow.  See view floor plan L1.
