## In Depth
The Revision.IssuedBy node in Dynamo is used to read the “Issued By” information from a revision in Revit. It helps teams quickly identify who created or issued a revision, making documentation more transparent and easier to track.

In this graph, the Select Revision node is used to choose a revision from the project. The Revision.IssuedBy node extracts the “Issued By” value, and the Watch node displays the result. This setup allows users to review revision ownership without opening Revit’s revision manager manually.
