## In Depth
This node retrieves the list of all available Performance Adviser rules. These rules are the same built-in checks that Revit uses to identify potential performance or modeling issues.

In this example, the PerformanceAdviserRules node is used to pull a rule “View clipping is disabled” from the complete list, which can then be connected to other nodes for checking its properties or behavior. This helps users quickly work with specific performance rules.
