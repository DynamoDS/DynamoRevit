## In Depth
Creates a Revit family based on geometry defined within Dynamo.  
This example shows Dynamo geometry being created to represent a floor.  We use this geometry as our solidGeometry value, with a family name, category, family template path, material and subcategory to create a new family type.  Lastly, we take this new family type and create an instance in the project at the top corner of the building.
