## In Depth
This node gets the unit being used in a project for any given Spec Type.

In this example, Spec Types values (Area and Cost per Area) are input into a list.  This list is used in the Document.UnitTypeBySpecType node as the input for specType along with the current document as the document input.  The results show the project specific spec type unit values for the current project.
