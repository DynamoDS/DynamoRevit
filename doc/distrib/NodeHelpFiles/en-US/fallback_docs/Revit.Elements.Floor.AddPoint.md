## In Depth

This node adds a point to a given floor.

In this example a number slider is used to generate a rectangle which is then used as an input to Floor.ByOutlineTypeAndLevel along with a given floor type and level.  We use this floor along with a new point as inputs to Floor.AddPoint.  The new point must be between one of the startpoints and end points of the floor sketch or on the floors boundary (an example of a new point is the middle point of a line).
