`CurtainPanel.AsFamilyInstance` converts the input curtain panel element to a Revit family instance. This is useful for obtaining element parameters, or extracting type properties from the curtain panel.

In the example below, all curtain panels are obtained from a curtain wall element selected by element id, and the curtain panels are then converted to family instances.
