## In Depth
The Revision.IssuedTo node in Dynamo is used to read the “Issued To” information from a revision in Revit. This helps teams track who the revision was issued to.

In this graph, the Select Revision node is used to pick a specific revision from the project. The Revision.IssuedTo node then extracts the “Issued To” field, and the result is displayed in the Watch node.
