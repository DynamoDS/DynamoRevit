## In Depth
This node finds all connection nodes that are permutations of one another { [beam1, beam2], [beam2, beam1] }, keeps only the first node { [beam1, beam2] } and removes null and empty items.

In this example, a beam structure element has been selected to illustrate the default condition of two connection nodes that are permutations are reduced to one.
