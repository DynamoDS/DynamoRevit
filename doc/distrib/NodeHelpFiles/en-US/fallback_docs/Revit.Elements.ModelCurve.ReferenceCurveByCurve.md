## In Depth
This node generates a Revit reference line (reference curve) within a Revit family document.

In this example, coordinates generated by a number slider define the start and end points of a model curve, which is then fed into this node. The final node in the sequence presents all the parameters and their corresponding values for the newly generated reference line. This node's functionality is limited to Revit family documents.
