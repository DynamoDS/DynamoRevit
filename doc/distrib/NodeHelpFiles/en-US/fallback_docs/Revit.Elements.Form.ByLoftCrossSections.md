## In Depth
This node creates a form from a list of curves and a Boolean value defining if the output form is solid or a surface.  This node works with massing, adaptive, and pattern-based family.

In this example, multiple cross-section curves are defined and fed into the Form.ByLoftCrossSections node. The node then generates a continuous 3D form by lofting through these sections.
