## In Depth
This node changes the join order between two Revit elements that are already geometrically joined.  This node lets the user determine which element’s geometry “cuts” or takes precedence over the other.

In this example two joined walls are selected and used as inputs (cuttingElement and otherElement) to the Element.SetGeometryJoinOrder node.  The output is the assigned join order.
