## In Depth
This node extracts the underlying geometric plane from a Reference Plane element.

In this graph, two points are defined with coordinates and connected to the ReferencePlane.ByStartPointEndPoint node to create a reference plane. The created reference plane is then passed into the ReferencePlane.Plane node, which outputs its geometric plane.
