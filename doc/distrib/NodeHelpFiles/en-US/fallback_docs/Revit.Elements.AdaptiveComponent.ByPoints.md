## In Depth
This node places instances of an adaptive component by defining its adaptive points directly from a list of point coordinates and specifying the family type to be used.

In this example, a single point is provided to the AdaptiveComponent.ByPoints node along with the adaptive component "Diagnostic Tripod – 1 Point.rfa" for input familyType.  The output is an adaptive component instance placed at the 1,1,0 of the mass family.  Note that the "Diagnostic Tripod – 1 Point.rfa" needs to be loaded into your mass family before running this graph.
