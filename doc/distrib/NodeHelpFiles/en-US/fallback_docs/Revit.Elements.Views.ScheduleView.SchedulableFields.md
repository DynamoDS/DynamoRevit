## In Depth
Similar to `ScheduleView.Fields`, `ScheduleView.SchedulableFields` retrieves fields that apply to a schedule view. However, these fields include all possible parameters for the given schedule view type, whether they are used or not.

In the example below, a door schedule is collected from the current Revit file and the possible schedulable fields are reported.
