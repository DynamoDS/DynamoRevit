## In Depth
The Revision.RevisionDate node in Dynamo is used to read the date assigned to a specific revision in Revit. It helps users extract revision date information as a text string.

In this graph, the Select Revision node is used to pick a revision from the project, and the Revision.RevisionDate node retrieves its date. The result is displayed in the Watch node, allowing users to easily review the chosen revision’s date without opening Revit’s revision settings manually.
