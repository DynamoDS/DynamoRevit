## In Depth
This node takes a collection of connection nodes and filters them based on the specified number of zones. It returns only those nodes that contain at least the given number of subnodes (zones), and then breaks each qualifying node into a list of its subnodes.

In this example, only elements with three or more connection zones are included in the output. Each resulting sublist represents a different grouping or structural arrangement within the original element.
