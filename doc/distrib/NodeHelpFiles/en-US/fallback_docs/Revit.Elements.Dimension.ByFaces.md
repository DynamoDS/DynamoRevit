## In Depth
This node creates a dimension based on selecting two planar faces of model elements, measuring the distance between those faces.
  
In this example, view “L1” from sheet A101 is used as an input into Dimension.ByFaces along with surfaces, a line, suffix and a prefix.  The line input allows the dimension to be offset from the selected faces.
