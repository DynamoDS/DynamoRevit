## In Depth
This node places adaptive components by mapping parameter values along a selected curve to define placement positions for the adaptive family type.

In this example, a curve is drawn in the mass family and used for curve input. Parameter values are provided to position instances along the curve, and the "Diagnostic Tripod – 1 Point.rfa" family is chosen as the family type. The AdaptiveComponent.ByParametersOnCurveReference node outputs adaptive components placed along the selected curve.  Note that the "Diagnostic Tripod – 1 Point.rfa" needs to be loaded into your mass family before running this graph.
