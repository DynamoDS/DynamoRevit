## In Depth
Defines the visible area of a view in Revit by setting the crop box to a specified bounding box. 

In this example two model elements are selected a viewport and a floor as inputs, the result is set crop box for that viewport.  Additionally, it allows you to control what part of the model is displayed within a particular view, effectively cropping the view to focus on a specific region.
