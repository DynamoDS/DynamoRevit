## In Depth
This node creates a dimension based on one or more edge references in a given view.

In this example, view “L1” from sheet A101 is used as an input into Dimension.ByEdges along with referenceCurves, a line, suffix and a prefix.  The line input allows the dimension to be offset from the selected faces.  The last 2 nodes show the dimensions values and their prefix.
