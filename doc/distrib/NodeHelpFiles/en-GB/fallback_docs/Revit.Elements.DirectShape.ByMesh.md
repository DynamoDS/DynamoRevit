## In Depth
This node creates a DirectShape using a mesh geometry type with category, material and a unique name.

In this example, a family that has mesh geometry modeled is selected and used to extract itsâ€™ mesh and name to create a direct shape along with a category and material.  Warnings will show if any of the selected elements are not in mesh format.  See Object.Type node results for clarification on geometry types (Mesh, Solid).
