## In Depth
`View.DuplicateView` attempts to duplicated the given view with the given duplication option. If the view cannot be duplicated, a null value is returned.

In the example below, all drafting views are collected from the current Revit document. The drafting views are then duplicated "with detailing" with a prefix of (N).
