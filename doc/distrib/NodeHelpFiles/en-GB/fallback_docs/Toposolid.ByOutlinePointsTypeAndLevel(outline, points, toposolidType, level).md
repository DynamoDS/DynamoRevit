## In Depth

`Toposolid.ByOutlinePointsTypeAndLevel` creates a Toposolid element in the current Revit document, given the inputs.

In the example below, an existing floor (with modified points) is selected to be converted into a Toposolid. The floor's shape points, outline and level are extracted for use in Toposolid creation. Finally, a Toposolid is created to replace the floor and the floor element is deleted.
