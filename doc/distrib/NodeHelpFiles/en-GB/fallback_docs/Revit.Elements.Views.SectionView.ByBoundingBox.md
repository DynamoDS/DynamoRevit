## In Depth
Creates section views based on a bounding box input.

This example shows how to automate the creation of section views in Revit. We start by selecting two walls, then generate their bounding boxes. Finally, two new section views are created, each sized precisely to the bounding box of the walls. This node is perfect for generating sections based on the geometry's exact dimensions.
