## In Depth
This node returns the curve of a detail line.

Here's how we're creating a wall from a detail line: First, we generate a start point and an end point to define a curve. This curve, along with a specified view, then serves as the input to create a detail line. We then extract the detail line's position using DetailCurve.Curve, and finally, use that position to model a wall.
