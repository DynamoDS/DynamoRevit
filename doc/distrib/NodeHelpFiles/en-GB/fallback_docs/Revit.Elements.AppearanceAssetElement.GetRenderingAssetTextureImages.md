## In Depth
This node retrieves all texture images associated with the rendering asset of a given AppearanceAssetElement in Revit. An Appearance Asset defines the visual properties of a material (such as color, reflectivity, bump, or transparency).

In this example, the AppearanceAssetElement's are selected and used as the input to the AppearanceAssetElement.GetRenderingAssetTextureImages node.  The results are the image properties and image paths for the given appearance asset element.  Empty lists are displayed when the appearance asset element has no value.
