## In Depth
`Sheet.Views` obtains all views placed on the given sheet. If the given sheet does not have any views placed, an empty list is returned. Keep in mind, this node returns the view elements, not the viewport elements. To obtain those elements, `Sheet.Viewports` may be used.

In the example below, the First Floor Plan sheet is selected, with the views and viewports reported.
