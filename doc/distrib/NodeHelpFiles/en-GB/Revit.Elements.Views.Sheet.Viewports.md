## In Depth
`Sheet.Viewports` obtains all viewports placed on the given sheet. If the given sheet does not have any viewports placed, an empty list is returned. Keep in mind, this node returns the viewport elements, not the view elements. To obtain those elements, `Sheet.Views` may be used.

In the example below, the First Floor Plan sheet is selected, with the views and viewports reported.
