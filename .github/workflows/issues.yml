name: Issues workflow
# This workflow transfers or moves issues based upon assigned labels.

# DynamoRevitIssues project https://github.com/orgs/DynamoDS/projects/7
# Built-in workflow https://github.com/orgs/DynamoDS/projects/7/workflows

# The built-in workflow
#   - adds any new issues to DynamoRevitIssues project
#   - sets status as 'Triage' when an item is added to the project
#   - sets status as 'Backlog' when an item is reopened
#   - sets status as 'Done' when an item is closed

# This workflow complements the built in workflow and
#   - moves issues labeled as 'Dynamo' to 'DynamoDS/Dynamo' repository
#   - moves issues labeled as 'Wishlist' to 'DynamoDS/DynamoWishlist' repository
#   - moves issues labeled as 'tracked' to 'Todo' column the project
#   - moves assigned issues to 'In Progress' column the project
